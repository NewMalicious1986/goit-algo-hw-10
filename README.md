## Results

- **Monte Carlo Estimate:**  
  The estimated area under the curve (integral) is approximately **2.66667** (depending on the number of random points used).

- **Analytical Result (SciPy quad):**  
  The computed integral is: approx **2.66667**

## Conclusions

- **Accuracy:**  
  The Monte Carlo method yields an accurate estimate for the integral of \( f(x) = x^2 \) over the interval \([0, 2]\) when a sufficient number of random points is used.

- **Validation:**  
  The close agreement between the Monte Carlo estimate and the analytical result from SciPy's `quad` validates the Monte Carlo approach for this problem.

- **Practical Implications:**  
  This exercise confirms that the Monte Carlo integration method is a viable tool for approximating definite integrals, particularly when dealing with complex or higher-dimensional integrals where analytical solutions may be difficult or impossible to obtain.
